- 9 degrees (GPS) = 1000km [http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gccalc.shtml]
- 1m = 9/(1000*1000) = 9 x 10^(-6) degrees [TOO SMALL]
- Radius of no honking = 200m [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/No-honking-within-200-metre-radius-of-high-court-other-courts/articleshow/13039850.cms]
- 200m = 2 x 10^2 x 9 x 10^(-6) = 18 x (10^-4) = 1.8 x 10^(-3) = 0.0018 degrees

- 200m = 0.0018 degrees
